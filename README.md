Kudos to @ https://github.com/omgmog/archarm-usb-hp-chromebook-11
but based off the steps here: http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/samsung/samsung-chromebook

I got tired of all the typing so posting here

on chromeos ensure you have :
- developer mode enabled
- run ```dev_install```
- you installed parted: ```emerge parted```
